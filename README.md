### Motivation

Swagger is a project used to describe and document RESTful APIs.
Unlike Servant it is language-agnostic and thus is quite popular among developers
in different languages. It also exists for a longer time and has more tools to work with.

This package provides means to generate Swagger specification for a Servant API
and also to partially test whether API conforms with its specification.

Generated Swagger specification then can be used for many things such as
- displaying interactive documentation using [Swagger UI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/);
- generating clients and servers in many languages using [Swagger Codegen](http://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/);
- and [many others](http://swagger.io/open-source-integrations/).

### Usage

Please refer to [haddock documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-swagger).

Some examples can be found in [`example/` directory](/example).

### Try it out

All generated swagger specifications can be interactively viewed on [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/).

Ready-to-use specification can be served as JSON and interactive API documentation
can be displayed using [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui).

Many Swagger tools, including server and client code generation for many languages, can be found on
[Swagger's Tools and Integrations page](http://swagger.io/open-source-integrations/).
